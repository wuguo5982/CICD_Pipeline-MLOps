## ⚙️ End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building, containerizing, and deploying a machine learning model using industry-standard **DevOps** and **MLOps** practices.  
>  *Note: This project is intended for educational and hands-on practice purposes.*

### 🚀 Core Components

1. **🧱 Dockerization**
   - Containerization of ML applications using Docker and Kubernetes  
   - Creation of reproducible, platform-independent environments

2. **🔁 GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Automates testing, building, and deployment pipelines  
   - Enables CI/CD integration directly from GitHub repositories

3. **☁️ AWS ECR & EC2 Integration**
   - Build and push Docker images to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**  
   - Configure **EC2 instances** for deployment using self-hosted GitHub runners

4. **✅ Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Leverage **AWS CodeCommit**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodePipeline**  
   - Automate code integration, testing, and packaging in response to repository updates

5. **🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Deploys containerized applications to EC2 instances via CI/CD workflows  
   - Uses GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners for production-style simulation

---

### 🖥️ EC2 Setup & Deployment Instructions

- Install and configure **Docker** on the EC2 instance  
- Register EC2 as a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner**  
- Secure the instance and configure access to **ECR & S3 (optional)**  
- Trigger automated deployment via GitHub Actions upon code push or PR

---

### ⚙️ Web App & API Integration

- **Flask-based Web Application**
   - Serves trained ML models through a simple user interface
   - Handles prediction requests and response formatting

- *(Optional Upgrade)*: **FastAPI-based RESTful API**
   - Scalable, production-ready API for serving models  
   - Supports async endpoints, JSON serialization, and OpenAPI documentation

---

### 📦 Deployment Scenarios (Practice Use Cases)

- Develop and containerize ML pipelines  
- Simulate production deployment on **AWS EC2** using Docker and CI/CD  
- Alternative deployment pathway via **Azure Cloud** using GitHub Actions  
- Build, push, and version-control ML models via **ECR** and **GitHub workflows**
